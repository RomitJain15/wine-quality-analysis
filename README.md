# Wine Quality Prediction (EDA + ML)

This project explores the Wine Quality dataset using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and applies **Machine Learning models** to predict wine quality based on physicochemical properties.

## Dataset

- **Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality)
- The dataset includes features like acidity, sugar, pH, alcohol, etc., for red and white wines.
- Target variable: **Wine quality** (integer score between 0â€“10)

## Objectives

- Perform EDA to understand feature distributions and correlations
- Build classification/regression models to predict wine quality
- Evaluate models using appropriate metrics

## Techniques Used

- **EDA:** seaborn, matplotlib, pandas
- **Models:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.
- **Preprocessing:** Scaling, Label Encoding, Train/Test Split
- **Metrics:** Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report
